============================================
Application of Python style:

Which aspects of the style guide were most applicable to your codebase?
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters
  --> __init__.py lines 71 and 83 are now multiple lines
- Order and position of imports:
  - Imports should be grouped in the following order:
    1. Standard library imports.
    2. Related third party imports.
    3. Local application/library specific imports.
  --> __init__.py lines 7-12, db.py lines 7-11 have imports in the correct order

Which aspects of the style guide were most useful/appreciated by your Devos?
- Appreciated: Indentation
- Useful: Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
- Appreciated: Function and Variable Names
============================================

============================================
Application of JavaScript style:
Note: So far, we don't have that much JavaScript in our codebase.

Which aspects of the style guide were most applicable to your codebase?
- Variable names, variable declarations
  - If a variable will not be reassigned, use const
  --> random.html lines 21-26 now use const rather than let
- Console Logging
  - When logging a message, use console.log(); when logging an error, use console.error().
  --> random.html line 36 now uses console.error()

Which aspects of the style guide were most useful/appreciated by your Devos?
- Appreciated: Comments
- Appreciated: Use braces with control flow statements and loops
- Useful: Conditional operators
