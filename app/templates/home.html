  <p>Color Theory for Dummies is a website that uses interactive examples, games, and images to teach dummies about the elusive concept that is color theory. Is the dress white and gold or is it black and blue? Is the sneaker grey and teal or white and pink? How does context change the way we perceive color? Just as your brain can change how you perceive color, we’ll challenge you to guess how the colors in different images have been manipulated. We present to you: Color Theory, made by dummies for dummies.</p>

  <!-- What is Color Theory -->
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-4xl"> What is Color Theory? </h2>
    <p> Color Theory is the study of how colors interact, are perceived, and evoke emotions.
  Artists use color theory to make intentional choices in their works, whether that be in crafting form, representing light, or expressing mood.

  <!-- Defining Color -->
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-4xl">  Defining Color </h2>
    <p>
      Hue, saturation, and brightness are the three primary ways to describe colors.
  Hue is the “color” of colors. It’s what distinguishes blue from red. It’s probably the first thing that comes to mind when you’re asked to imagine two different colors.
  Saturation measures the intensity/purity of a color. The more saturated a color is, the more vivid it appears to be. A less saturated color will appear to be more muted and grey. For example, crimson would be a more saturated red, while brick would be a more desaturated red.
  Brightness refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. Think of the typical greyscale, where colors range from a lighter white to grey to a darker black. When we add white to a color, we end up with a tint of that color. When black is added, we get a shade.

  Color is informed by its context
  Color is relative to all the colors around it
  Perception in light or shadow
  Color vision: how we perceive color. Color constancy is the brain’s effort to recognize a familiar object as a consistent color regardless of the light that is reflected off it
